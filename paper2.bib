   abstract = {Host plant traits strongly affect survivorship of insect herbivores, and host suitability is especially important for the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton, which spends its entire egg, larval, and pupal periods in a single stem. Measuring larval survival inside stems from egg hatch through diapause-mediated dormancy is a potential measure of population size for the next year but is also useful in assessing effects of growing season precipitation and temperature. Larval growth is synchronized with host plant growth, and the larva cannot switch hosts. Thus, incorporating plant physiological time, as growing degree days (GDD), may yield a better prediction of larval survival. Therefore, we assessed wheat stem sawfly survival from early larval growth to the beginning of autumnal diapause in barley cultivars selected from across feed, forage, and two-or six-row malt groups. Field experiments were conducted in Gallatin and Chouteau counties, Montana, in 2016 and 2017. We used Kaplan-Meier estimation to assess larval survival among cultivars. We found that the survival of pre-diapause larvae was greatest in 'Hockett' (36.5%) and lowest in 'Celebration' (15.4%). Precipitation and temperature during the growing season affected temporal patterns for larval survival across study sites. Adjusting survivorship curves using site-specific GDD accumulation allowed cultivar-specific survivorship to be estimated more precisely for each site, despite differing environmental influences. Our findings suggest that measuring wheat stem sawfly survival across barley cultivars and standardizing by site-specific GDDs may provide better recommendations on barley cultivars that impede wheat stem sawfly population growth and reduce economic losses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cephus cinctus infestation causes $350 million in annual losses in the Northern Great Plains. We compared infestation and parasitism of C. cinctus in spring (including Kamut; Triticum turgidum ssp. turanicum) and winter wheat cultivars grown in organic and conventional fields in Montana, USA. In the greenhouse, we compared C. cinctus preference and survival in Kamut, Gunnison, and Reeder spring wheat cultivars. RESULTS: Stems cut by C. cinctus varied by farming system and the seasonality of the wheat crop. No stems of Kamut in organic fields were cut by C. cinctus, but 1.5% [±0.35% standard error (SE)] of stems in conventional spring wheat, 5% (±0.70% SE) of stems in organic winter wheat, and 20% (±0.93% SE) of stems in conventional winter wheat fields were cut by C. cinctus. More larvae of C. cinctus were parasitized in organic (27 ± 0.03% SE) compared with conventional (5 ± 0.01% SE) winter wheat fields. Cephus cinctus oviposition, survival, and the number of stems cut were lowest in Kamut compared with Gunnison and Reeder. CONCLUSION: Cephus cinctus infestation was more common in winter wheat than in spring wheat. Organic fields with fewer cut stems also supported more parasitoids. Kamut is a genetic resource for developing C. cinctus-resistant cultivars. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.},

   abstract = {Covering about 40% of Earth's land surface and sustaining at least 38% of global population, drylands are key crop and animal production regionswith high economic and social values. However, land use changes associated with industrialized agricultural managements are threatening the sustainability of these systems. While previous studies assessing the impacts of agricultural management systems on biodiversity and their services focused on more diversified mesic landscapes, there is a dearth of such research in highly simplified dryland agroecosystems. In this paper, we 1) summarize previous research on the effects of farm management systems and agricultural expansion on biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystem services, 2) present four case studies assessing the impacts of management systems on biodiversity and ecosystem services across highly simplified dryland landscapes of the Northern Great Plains (NGP), USA, 3) discuss approaches to sustain biodiversity-based ecosystem services in drylands, and 4) present a conceptual framework for enhancing agricultural sustainability in the drylands through research, policy, economic valuation, and adaptivemanagement. An analysis of the land use changes due to agricultural expansion within the Golden Triangle, a representative agricultural area in the NGP, indicated that the proportion of land conversion to agriculture area was 84%, 8%, and 7% from grassland, riparian, and shrubland habitats, respectively. Our results showed this simplificationwas associatedwith a potential reduction of pollination services. Also, our economic analysis projected that if 30% parasitismcould be achieved through bettermanagement systems, the estimated potential economic returns to pest regulation services through parasitoids inMontana, USA alone could reach about $11.23 million. Overall, while dryland agroecosystems showed a significant loss of native biodiversity and its services, greater pest incidence, and a decrease in plant pollinator networks, these trends were moderately reversed in organically managed farming systems. In conclusion, although land use changes due to agricultural expansion and industrialized farming threaten the sustainability of dryland agroecosystems, this impact can be partially offset by coupling ecologically-based farming practices with adaptive management strategies.},

It is a species native to the United States and has been gradually coming into prominence since the beginning of the present century by reason of the change which the feeding habits of the larvæ have been undergoing subsequent to its discovery. Originally a grass feeder, it is becoming a serious menace to the grain growers of the Northwestern States because of its acquired appetite for small grains, within the stems of which it now subsists. Such changes of diet are probably occurring everywhere with greater frequency than formerly was deemed possible, especially among the phytophagous insects of the Middle West . When given a chance to feed upon the various cultivated plants grown in bulk by the farmer or gardener, many of these insects gradually desert their native host plants and to a greater or less degree change their habits , including in their fare the more succulent and easily found food.},

We use a unique farm-level dataset to estimate the expected losses associated with WSS and then evaluate two popular WSS management strategies.

Cumulative grain-yield losses and annual economic losses associated with this pest can exceed 30% and350 million, respectively. Solid-stemmed cultivars of common wheat, Triticum aestivum L.

Furthermore, chemical control (a primary control option for other cereal (Poaceae) insect pests) has proven ineffective; this underscores the need to integrate resistant cultivars into a comprehensive integrated pest management program.

   abstract = {The wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus Norton [Hymenoptera: Cephidae]) is a serious threat to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other cereal grains in the northern Great Plains. Insecticides have proven ineffective for sawfly control and can be detrimental to beneficial insects. The management of wheat stem sawfly, therefore, requires the integration of host plant resistance, agronomic and biological control strategies. Recent studies in Alberta, Canada have assessed the response of wheat stem sawfly and its natural enemies to cultivar selection, residue management, seeding rates, fertility regimes, and harvest management. Solid-stemmed cultivars are usually agronomically superior to susceptible cultivars when sawflies are present. The stubble disturbance associated with residue management and direct-seeding in a continuous cropping system can reduce sawfly populations compared to a wheat-fallow system. Increased seeding rates can optimize yield, but an inverse, negative relationship between pith expression (stem solidness) and higher seeding rates may occur. Positive yield responses are typically observed with N rates > 30 kg N ha-1 , but increased insect stem cutting by sawfly can occur with higher N rates. Increasing cutter bar heights during combine harvest can conserve natural enemies, and chopping straw for improved residue management in the spring will not likely affect wheat stem sawfly parasitoids that overwinter in the straw. In summary, an integrated strategy to manage wheat stem sawfly consists of diligent pest surveillance, planting solid-stemmed cultivars, continuous cropping with appropriate pre-seed residue management, seeding rates no greater than 300 seeds m-2 , 30 to 60 kg N ha-1 , and harvest cutting heights of at least 15 cm to conserve parasitoids.},

   abstract = {Wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (WSS), is an important pest of cereal crops in Northern Great Plains. Smooth brome has historically been suggested as a potential trap crop around wheat fields in Montana. The objective of this study was to compare oviposition preference and selection behaviors of female WSS and measure subsequent larval survival in wheat and smooth brome stems. We compared infestation, parasitism and larval development of WSS using field transects in smooth brome and adjacent wheat fields. We found no clear difference in infestation between the two host plants. There was greater larval mortality and less tunneling in smooth brome stems compared to wheat at a site near Big Sandy, Montana. At a second site near Big Sandy, there was greater infestation in smooth brome compared to wheat, but there were more dead larvae and greater parasitism in smooth brome. In Y-tube olfactometer studies, WSS females were more attracted to volatiles emitted by smooth brome than wheat. In greenhouse trials, the observation of specific behaviors leading to oviposition indicated differences in duration of ovipositor insertion and in number of ovipositor insertions that favored greater oviposition in smooth brome, but only by emergence of the first awn of the inflorescence (Zadoks 49 growth stage). There were different numbers of eggs in smooth brome stems relative to wheat, with no difference in the proportion of infested stems in choice tests conducted for two days at Zadoks 49. In no-choice tests, there were differences in both infested stems and in the number of eggs in stems at Zadoks 49. We found significantly greater amounts of key behaviorally active compounds used by female WSS, like (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and β-ocimene, that were among the few differences in the amounts of volatile compounds collected from two plant species. The greater amount of these compounds leads to more eggs that subsequently experience greater larval mortality in young plants, resulting in fewer cut stems in mature plants. Our findings support the consideration of smooth brome for use in trap crops to improve integrated pest management strategies for WSS.},

   abstract = {This study investigated the dynamics of parasitism, host plant resistance, pathogens, and predation on the demography of wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), developing in susceptible (hollow stem) and resistant (solid stem) wheat hosts. This study is also the first to investigate the prevalence and impact of cannibalism on wheat stem sawfly mortality. Wheat stem sawflies were sampled in two commercial wheat fields over 4 yr from the egg stage through adult emergence, and multiple decrement life tables were constructed and analyzed. Cannibalism, host plant resistance, or unknown factors were the most prevalent factors causing egg mortality. Summer mortality of prediapause larvae ranged from 28 to 84%, mainly due to parasitism by Bracon cephi (Gaban) and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck, cannibalism, and host plant resistance. Winter mortality ranged from 6 to 54% of the overwintering larvae, mainly due to unknown factors or pathogens. Cannibalism is a major cause of irreplaceable mortality because it is absolute, with only a single survivor in every multiple infested stem. Subsequent to obligate cannibalism, mortality of feeding larvae due to host plant resistance was lower in hollow stem wheat than in solid stem wheat. Mortality from host plant resistance was largely irreplaceable. Irreplaceable mortality due to parasitoids was greater in hollow stem wheat than in solid stem wheat. Host plant resistance due to stem solidness and parasitism in hollow stems cause substantial mortality in populations of actively feeding larvae responsible for all crop losses. Therefore, enhancing these mortality factors is vital to effective integrated pest management of wheat stem sawfly.},

However, final reproductive output was not significantly different between ears on infested stems that supported complete larval development compared with ears on uninfested stems. 3: Stems containing parasitized larvae and stems containing larvae that died before completing their development had a higher mean number of seeds and seed weight, when accounting for number of fertile spikelets of each ear, than either infested with live larvae and uninfested stems. 4: The results obtained suggest that larval feeding prevented infested stems from attaining their yield potential, and that the negative impact of the pest on wheat yield was reduced when late instar sawfly larvae were parasitized. Even though some feeding occurs before parasitism, this early damage has a comparatively low impact on yield. 5: This is the first study to show a yield benefit and enhanced plant fitness due to the wheat stem sawfly parasitoids B. cephi and B. lissogaster.

   abstract = {The wheat stem sawfly (WSS), Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), causes significant damage in cereal crops in the northern Great Plains of North America. This study assessed oviposition preference in winter wheat, Triticum aestivum L. (Poaceae), and investigated how it is affected by the emission of semiochemicals, with the overall goal of enhancing trap crop efficacy. We studied five winter wheat cultivars that could be recommended as trap crops for WSS and compared them with regards to agronomic characteristics influencing oviposition behavior and their emission of behaviorally active volatiles. Subsequently, we evaluated oviposition preference on three selected cultivars, 'Norstar', 'Neeley', and 'Rampart', using choice tests at two plant growth stages. Most eggs were found in Norstar at both stages tested when females were exposed to the three cultivars simultaneously making it the preferred choice for a trap crop. Norstar also emitted more behaviorally active volatiles, primarily (E)- and (Z)-β-ocimene. The results for the effect of main stem height or diameter on oviposition was inconsistent between infested vs. uninfested stems within cultivars, although there was a correlation between infestation and height for younger plants. These results show that these agronomic characteristics, typically viewed as explanatory, did not clearly explain oviposition preference and suggest a role of β-ocimene in determining suitability for oviposition among these cultivars. This study supports previous findings suggesting oviposition preference in winter wheat involves several cues, including stem height and volatile attractants that may be important in determining suitability. © 2012 The Authors.

   abstract = {Insect herbivores typically oviposit on the most suitable hosts, but choices can be modulated by detection of potential competition among conspeciÞcs, especially when eggs are deposited cryptically. Larvae of the wheat stem sawßy, Cephus cinctus Norton, developing within an already infested stem, experience elevated risk when only one will survive because of cannibalism. To increase our understanding of host selection when the choices made by females can lead to severe intraspeciÞc competition, females were presented with either uninfested wheat plants or with plants previously exposed to other females in laboratory choice tests. The oviposition behavior of this insect was described by recording the behavioral sequences that lead to and follow the insertion of the ovipositor in both previously infested and uninfested stems. No signiÞcant differences were found in frequencies of speciÞc behaviors or behavioral transitions associated with oviposition. In choice tests, there was no difference in the numbers of eggs laid in infested and uninfested plants. Taller plants received more eggs, irrespective of infestation. Females neither preferred nor avoided previously infested hosts. Other characteristics of the host, such as stem height, may be more important in determining suitability for oviposition. These Þndings support the use of management tactics relying on the manipulation of oviposition behavior, such as trap cropping. Given that there is no evidence for response to previously infested hosts, the infested plants in a trap crop would remain as suitable as they were when uninfested, which could also lead to an increase in mortality caused by intraspeciÞc competition.},

   abstract = {Small floral patches that coexist with crops in agricultural landscapes can function as biodiversity reservoirs. However, the influence of the landscape context and agricultural management on the capacity of these small green infrastructures to support diversity is poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the effect of landscape simplification, agricultural intensification in the neighbourhood, and quality of the floral habitats on the success of these patches to support flower-visiting insect communities as well as the pollination service they provide. To this aim, we sampled floral patches located in 18 paired olive farms with contrasting herb cover management (intensive vs. low-intensity), distributed along a wide gradient of landscape complexity at the regional scale of South Spain. We conducted surveys of flower-visiting insects in 36 multi-floral stands and 36 mono-floral stands of Sinapis alba Linnaeus (1753) within these floral patches. Mono-floral stands were used to evaluate variations in the pollination service through number of viable seeds and seed set. Results revealed that the abundance and diversity of flower-visiting insects respond to the quality of the floral patch (diversity of flowers) but not to landscape context nor agricultural management around it. Moreover, the pollination service was similar and high (seed set ca. 100 %) in all floral patches regardless of their context. Our findings highlight the importance of even small floral patches that function as reservoirs of diversity of flower-visiting insects and the pollination service. They also show the high resistance of these patches to agricultural intensification and simplification in olive grove landscapes.},

A total of 618 arthropods were collected from plants along the periphery: Insecta (589), Arachnida (20), and Entognatha (9). Hemiptera was the most prevalent order (49.84%). Kale plants near the periphery experienced less predation from leaf beetles. Plants along the periphery hosted important predator groups as well as phytophages that can serve as alternative prey.

Within the prairie pothole region of the United States and Canada, the grass, Bromus inermis (smooth brome) has become established by invading disturbed prairies, and through repeated introductions for soil retention and animal graze. In this study, the impact of smooth brome on the patch dynamics of a dominant native grass species, Spartina pectinata (prairie cordgrass), was assessed using fine-scale (sub-meter) mapping of the distribution of cordgrass and brome in three prairie fragments from 2000 to 2006. Using GIS spatial analyses, we determined that cordgrass patch growth was two times greater in areas not invaded by smooth brome versus areas that were heavily infested with smooth brome. Among sites and time periods, there was a consistent significant negative relationship between the amount of smooth brome surrounding a patch of cordgrass and the growth of that cordgrass patch. The probability of establishment of a new patch of cordgrass averaged 1.3 times higher in areas of low brome coverage (<25%) than areas of high brome coverage (>75%). Conversely, existing cordgrass patches were 7.8 times more likely to go extinct in areas of high than low brome coverage. This is one of only a few field studies to provide evidence of the negative impact of smooth brome on native flora and hopefully will serve as justification for the development of a formal management plan to limit the distribution of this species in tallgrass prairie ecosystems.},

Similarly sized third instar larvae of Hippodamia convergens and H. tredecimpunc-tara, H. convergens and H. sinuata, and H. convergens and Coccinella septempunctata, were tested in experiments designed to ensure that paired larvae experienced moderate competition. Interspecific competition in these experiments did not differ significantly from intraspecific competition, in that an individual's weight gain did not depend on whether its competitor was heterospecific or conspecific. Furthermore, aphid populations were reduced equally by heterospecific and conspecific pairs. These results suggest that there is little or no difference between intra and interspecific interactions among larvae of these ladybeetles when two similarly sized individuals co-occur on a host plant. Thus, the species diversity per se of assemblages of ladybeetle larvae may have little influence over the short term on the reduction of aphid populations by ladybeetle predation.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Wheat stem sawfly (WSS), Cephus cinctus Norton, is a major pest of common bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other cultivated cereals in North America. Planting of cultivars with solid stems has been the primary management strategy to prevent yield loss due to WSS infestation, however expression of this phenotype can vary depending on environmental conditions and solid stems hinder biological control of WSS via braconid parasitoids Bracon cephi (Gahan) and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck. In the hollow stems of oat (Avena sativa L.), WSS larvae experience 100% mortality before they reach late instars, but the mechanisms for this observed resistance have not been characterized. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore additional sources of resistance outside of the historic solid stem phenotype. Methods: Here, we use an untargeted metabolomics approach to examine the response of the metabolome of two cultivars of oat and four cultivars of spring wheat to infestation by WSS. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), differentially expressed metabolites were identified between oat and wheat which were associated with the phenylpropanoid pathway, phospholipid biosynthesis and signaling, the salicylic acid signaling pathway, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) degradation, and biosynthesis of 1,4-benzoxazin-3-ones (Bxs). Several phospho- and galacto- lipids were found in higher abundance in oat, and with the exception of early stem solidness cultivar Conan, both species experienced a decrease in abundance once infested. In all wheat cultivars except Conan, an increase in abundance was observed for Bxs HMDBOA-glc and DIBOA-β-D-glucoside after infestation, indicating that this pathway is involved in wheat response to infestation in both solid and hollow stemmed cultivars. Differences between species in compounds involved in IAA biosynthesis, degradation and inactivation suggest that wheat may respond to infestation by inactivating IAA or altering the IAA pool in stem tissue. Conclusion: We propose that the species differences found here likely affect the survival of WSS larvae and may also be associated with differences in stem architecture at the molecular level. Our findings suggest pathways to focus on for future studies in elucidating plant response to WSS infestation.},

   abstract = {Adults of B. cephi emerged at the same time as the adults of their host, the wheat stem sawfly, and started to oviposit about mid-July. The second generation started to emerge between August 5 and 15. This generation, which was complete in some years, was apparently only partial in years in which adults of the first generation continued to oviposit late in the season. In most cases the larvae of Bracon that were present at harvest time were from eggs laid after August 1. Most of the overwintering B. cephi were located in the lower internodes of the sawfly-infested wheat stems. Although B. cephi attacked some sawfly larvae in their stubs most sawflies escaped parasitism once they had cut their host stems. High host densities per stem in hollow-stemmed wheats were detrimental to Bracon during the early part of the season as the unparasitized sawfly larvae in stems containing B. cephi destroyed the parasite larvae. The sawfly-susceptible wheats were more suitable than the resistant for parasitism. Generally, differences in parasitism between wheats and between barleys were caused by differences in length of survival of the sawfly larvae in the different host plants; longer survival led to higher parasitism. The fluctuations in amounts of parasitism mainly depended on the synchronization of development between B. cephi and the sawfly. Parasitism increased when the sawfly larvae cut their host stems sufficiently late to allow establishment by the second generation of B. cephi and decreased when the sawfly cut too early for parasitism by the second generation. The date of ripening of the host plant governs the date of cutting by the sawfly; hence, the amount of parasitism is influenced by the levels of soil moisture and temperature during the growing season, by differences in rate of development of various plant hosts, and by the date of seeding. Low levels of parasitism resulted from early ripening of the sawfly host plants in two consecutive years, whereas a moderately high level occurred even though the weather of the current year was conducive to early ripening, provided that the wheat in the preceding year had ripened late. It appears that moderate to high levels of parasitism required that the crop ripen late in at least one year out of two. © 1963, Entomological Society of Canada. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = { The effects of the major factors on populations of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton, were studied in the field at Lethbridge, Alberta between 1970 and 1977. Fecundity of the females, which contain an average of 32.7 eggs, is influenced by the condition and variety of host plants in which they develop as larvae. Populations of the adults that emerge from infested crops cut 7–9% by the larvae in one year may infest 70–80% of the stems of adjacent crops in the following year. Increased adult densities, however, fail to increase markedly the percentage of stems infested because the adults concentrate at field margins when they reinfest the most preferred stems. Because only one larva can mature in each stem, competition within stems that receive more than one egg causes a major drop in the population but not in the percentage of infested stems cut. Another major drop is caused by host plant resistance, which is influenced in both susceptible and resistant wheats by the weather during the growing season. On an average, all of the larvae die in 28% of the infested stems of two susceptible wheats and in 67% of those of a resistant wheat. The mortality in resistant wheats, however, is generally not sufficient to prevent economic infestations in subsequent years. Parasitism, which was a major factor in only 7 of 36 years in southern Alberta, is increased by weather conditions that cause delayed ripening of the wheat crops. The mortality of mature larvae and pupae averaged 21.3%. It is affected by extremes of moisture and temperature and can be increased slightly by shallow tillage of infested stubble. },

   abstract = {Annual cropping systems consist of a shifting mosaic of habitats that vary through time in their availability and suitability to insect pests. Agroecosystem instability results from changes that occur within a season with crop planting, development, and harvest. Further instability results from continuous alterations in biotic and abiotic insect life system components and from agricultural inputs. Changes to agroecosystems occur across seasons with changing agricultural practices, changing cropping patterns, and technological innovations. Much of this instability is a result of events unconnected with pest management.

The abilities of polyphagous pest species to move among and utilize different habitat patches in response to changes in suitability enable the pests to exploit unstable cropping systems. These pest characteristics determine the location and timing of damaging populations. Habitat suitability is influenced by plant species and cultivar, crop phenology, and agricultural inputs. Pest movement is affected by a suite of intrinsic factors, such as population age structure and mobility, and extrinsic factors, including weather systems and habitat distribution.

The life systems of three selected polyphagous pests are presented to demonstrate how an understanding of such systems in agricultural ecosystems improves our ability to predict and hence manage these populations.},

   abstract = {The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), is a key pest of wheat in the northern Great Plains of North America, and damage resulting from this species has recently expanded southward. Current pest management practices are inadequate and uncertainty regarding geographic origin, as well as limited data on population structure and dynamics across North America impede progress towards more informed management. We examined the genetic divergence between samples collected in North America and northeastern Asia, the assumed native range of C. cinctus using two mitochondrial regions (COI and 16S). Subsequently, we characterized the structure of genetic diversity in the main wheat producing areas in North America using a combination of mtDNA marker and microsatellites in samples collected both in wheat fields and in grasses in wildlands. The strong genetic divergence observed between North American samples and Asian congeners, in particular the synonimized C. hyalinatus, did not support the hypothesis of a recent American colonization by C. cinctus. Furthermore, the relatively high genetic diversity both with mtDNA and microsatellite markers offered additional evidence in favor of the native American origin of this pest. The genetic diversity of North American populations is structured into three genetic clusters and these are highly correlated with geography. Regarding the recent southern outbreaks in North America, the results tend to exclude the hypothesis of recent movement of damaging wheat stem sawfly populations from the northern area. The shift in host plant use by local populations appears to be the most likely scenario. Finally, the significance of these findings is discussed in the context of pest management.

   abstract = {Historically, the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton was a pest in spring wheat-growing regions of the northern Great Plains. However, in the 1980s, it was found infesting winter wheat fields in Montana. Infestations were first detected in western Nebraska in the 1990s, and have since spread throughout the Nebraska Panhandle. Larval damage occurs from stem-mining, but stem girdling that results in lodged stems that are not harvested results in the greatest yield losses. The biology and phenology of the wheat stem sawfly are well described in the northern portion of its range, but they are lacking in Colorado, southeast Wyoming, and Nebraska. In this study, the phenology and dispersal of the wheat stem sawfly in Nebraska winter wheat fields is described using sweep net and larval sampling. During this 2-yr study, adult activity began on May 23 and ended on June 21. Adult sex ratios were 2.32 males per female in 2014 and 0.46 males per female in 2015. Both sexes demonstrated an edge effect within the wheat fields, with greater densities near the field edge. The edge effect was stronger for male wheat stem sawfly than females. Wheat stem sawfly larval density also had an edge effect, regardless of the density of female wheat stem sawfly present. This information will be useful for developing management plans for the wheat stem sawfly in Nebraska and neighboring regions.},

These farms consist of the current crop and idle fields in which the previous year's crop was located. Larvae of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), overwinter in post-harvest wheat stubble. Adults appear and disperse to new crops during the following growing season. Adults begin oviposition as soon as suitable hosts are encountered; therefore, larval infestations usually are concentrated along field borders. We tested several types of trap strips as intercepts to reduce dispersion of adult sawflies into fields. The most successful system was a fall-planted winter wheat trap that protected spring-planted wheat. These trap strips utilized the border effect as well as the higher attractiveness of the earlier maturing winter wheat. In another trial, losses were reduced by planting a semi-resistant solid-stemmed wheat cultivar within the border of a comparatively higher yielding hollow-stemmed cultivar.},

No changes could be detected in the seasonal phenology of winter wheat. Decreased acreage of spring wheat from 1921 to 1945 reduced host availability. C. cinctus wasps are now emerging 20 d earlier than previously, and oviposition activity currently closely coincides with susceptible growth stages of winter wheat.

   abstract = {The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), is the most serious insect pest of dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; Poaceae) in the southern Canadian Prairies and the northern Great Plains of the United States. We characterized the spatial distribution pattern of C. cinctus eggs and larvae throughout the adult flight period in three dryland winter wheat fields in Montana. Cephus cinctus females laid eggs in wheat stems until a few weeks before wheat maturity, and most wheat stems received only one egg. Wheat stem samples collected along the field edges represented 12%-16% of the samples but 40%-95% of the infested stems. The highest numbers of C. cinctus eggs and larvae found in a single wheat stem were 16 and 4, respectively. On a field scale, both C. cinctus eggs and larvae were significantly aggregated along field edges in most of the sampling events. A comparison of indices of aggregation revealed that C. cinctus larvae were significantly more spatially aggregated than C. cinctus eggs. Based on our spatiotemporal analysis, we speculate that the majority of the eggs are initially laid along field edges, and ovipositing C. cinctus females do not distinguish between previously infested and uninfested wheat stems. Gradually, these eggs hatch and the larvae begin feeding; at the same time, the later emerging C. cinctus females oviposit farther into the wheat fields. One explanation is that ovipositing C. cinctus females avoid stems containing feeding larvae. The analysis of the temporal changes in the spatial distribution patterns of C. cinctus eggs and larvae is discussed in the context of possible integrated pest management strategies. © 2005 Entomological Society of Canada.},

Bioclimatic simulation tools, such as Climex, predict the potential geographic distribution and establishment of insects in ecosystems, based on climate. The ecoclimatic index, a measure of ecological suitability, integrates potential population growth with stresses to produce estimates of relative abundance. This simulation software was used to develop a bioclimate model for C. cinctus in western Canada. Results fostered a better understanding of how C. cinctus responded to selected climate variables. Two general circulation models were then applied to assess the response of C. cinctus populations to future climate. Relative to current climate, predicted changes in C. cinctus distribution and relative abundance were greatest for 2030, with a small further increase for 2070. Across the Prairies and Boreal Plains Ecozones, changes in ecoclimatic index were greater than in geographic distribution.

Early reports of plants escaped from cultivation appear in 1903, and based on the number of collec- tions prior to 1920, smooth brome spread most rapidly in western Canada. It is common along roadsides, forest margins, clear- ings, shorelines and disturbed areas, but its most detrimental impact is on the diversity of prairies and native grasslands. For example, in Riding Mountain National Park, MB, plant diversity of fescue prairies recently invaded by smooth brome decreased by 70%. Vegetative proliferation through underground rhizomes is key to the invasiveness of smooth brome, but long-range dis- persal of seeds is facilitated by animals, wind and the transport of hay. Smooth brome is effectively controlled using selective applications of glyphosate and well-timed clipping. However, restoration of infested areas depends on the composition of native seed banks. Smooth brome remains valuable as a forage and cover crop in every province and territory in Canada. Key},

Thus, the objectives of this work were to: (1) describe rates of change in temperature averages and extremes for western Montana, a region containing sensitive resources and ecosystems, (2) investigate associations between Montana temperature change to hemispheric and global temperature change, (3) provide climate analysis tools for land and resource managers responsible for researching and maintaining renewable resources, habitat, and threatened/endangered species and (4) integrate our findings into a more general assessment of climate impacts on ecosystem processes and services over the past century. Over 100 years of daily and monthly temperature data collected in western Montana, USA are analyzed for long-term changes in seasonal averages and daily extremes. In particular, variability and trends in temperature above or below ecologically and socially meaningful thresholds within this region (e.g., -17.8°C (0°F), 0°C (32°F), and 32.2°C (90°F)) are assessed. The daily temperature time series reveal extremely cold days (≤ -17.8°C) terminate on average 20 days earlier and decline in number, whereas extremely hot days (≥32°C) show a three-fold increase in number and a 24-day increase in seasonal window during which they occur. Results show that regionally important thresholds have been exceeded, the most recent of which include the timing and number of the 0°C freeze/thaw temperatures during spring and fall. Finally, we close with a discussion on the implications for Montana's ecosystems. Special attention is given to critical processes that respond non-linearly as temperatures exceed critical thresholds, and have positive feedbacks that amplify the changes. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.},

However, landscape complexity does not always enhance biological control and in some cases may lead to increased pest populations. We examined the prevalence of two Bracon parasitoids, Bracon cephi Gahan and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), and their host the wheat stem sawfly Cephus cinctus Norton, a major pest of wheat. We assessed the degree of noncrop and crop host plant use and responses to landscape composition. We found no instances of parasitism by either Bracon species in our three-year, statewide winter wheat survey but found small populations of Bracon in noncrop landscapes throughout eastern and western Colorado. We used model selection to examine how local (500 m scale) and landscape (5 km scale) cover of suitable noncrop and crop habitats potentially affects abundances of Bracon and wheat stem sawfly. Our best fit model for wheat stem sawfly suggests that a decrease in noncrop cover at the landscape scale leads to an increase in wheat stem sawfly infestation. Our best fit model for Bracon parasitism suggests an increase in wheat cover at the local level results in the greatest increase in the odds of parasitism by either species of Bracon. Herbaceous cover at local and landscape scales were also significant predictors of Bracon parasitism. The results of this study suggest that pest and natural enemies respond differently to landscape composition and these responses should be evaluated before management decisions are made.},

Adult emergence was highest at 20 and 25C for the two populations collected at Amsterdam and Conrad (western Montana) and was highest at 15 and 20C for the population collected at Opheim (eastern Montana). Emerged females were twice as heavy as males. Temperature and relative humidity did not affect weight, but emerged adults from the populations collected at Amsterdam and Conrad were heavier than adults emerged from the population collected at Opheim. Sex ratio of emerging adults was female biased and was strongly affected by population. The optimal conditions for larvalÐadult development of C. cinctus lie between 20 and 25C and 60 Ð75% RH.

This tenet, restated as a hypothesis, is rejected based on moose population response to a chronic wolf decline. In 1980-1996 with wolf numbers down, partly due to introduced disease, moose numbers increased to a historic high level. There was insufficient density dependence in moose reproduction and mortality to stabilize moose numbers. In 1996 moose suffered a crash; 80% died, primarily from starvation. These fluctuations, along with the possibility that the highly inbred wolf population may become extinct, will challenge NPS policy.

Cephus cinctus has a wide host range, attacking numerous wild grasses and cultivated cereals in crop and grassland habitats, where it is, in turn, attacked by 2 native braconid parasitoids. Quantitative assessments of C. cinctus infestation and parasitism levels in different grass species across the full spectrum of available hosts are important in assessing the extent to which grasslands, or specific constituent grass species, may be reservoirs of pests or parasitoids moving into wheat. We quantified infestation and parasitism levels in over 25,000 stems collected from 17 grass species and wheat spanning 35 sites in central Montana, United States, over 2 yr. Infestation levels in 5 grass species, primarily wheatgrasses, were high (38%–65%) and similar to the levels observed in wheat (55%). In contrast, the majority of grass species (12 of 17) had significantly lower levels of infestation (&amp;lt;10%), suggesting that most grasses are not important reservoirs of C. cinctus. Parasitism levels in highly infested wheatgrasses were, on average, 3 times higher than those in cultivated wheat, suggesting that these grasses could provide important conservation habitat for parasitoids. Future work examining the relative performance of pests and parasitoids in these grasses will be important in gauging their relative value as plant materials to bolster parasitoid conservation in reseeded grassland habitats.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single-tool approaches often fail to provide effective long-term suppression of pest populations, such that combining several tools into an integrated management strategy is critical. Yet studies that harness the power of population models to explore the relative efficacy of various management tools and their combinations remain rare. We constructed a Leslie matrix population model to evaluate the potential of crop resistance, acting alone or in combination with biological control, to reduce populations of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton, a major pest of wheat in North America. RESULTS: Our model projections indicated that crop resistance reduced, but did not stop, C. cinctus population growth, suggesting that implementing multiple management tools will be necessary for longer term control of this pest. The levels of parasitism needed to curtail population growth were much lower in model projections for resistant solid-stemmed compared with susceptible hollow-stemmed cultivars (22% versus 86%). Furthermore, even when accounting for the reduced levels of parasitism observed in resistant cultivars, projected population growth rates for C. cinctus were always lower in resistant compared with susceptible wheat cultivars. CONCLUSION: Despite some empirical evidence for antagonistic interactions between resistance and biological control, our models suggest that combining these two approaches will always reduce population growth rates to lower levels than implementing either strategy alone. More work focused on integrating biological control into crop resistance breeding programs, and determining how these approaches affect performance of limiting life stages, will be important to optimize sustainable approaches to integrated pest management in this system and more broadly.

The wheat stem sawfly was first reported from wild grasses where populations were often highly parasitized by a number of parasitoids, including Bracon (= Microbracon) cephi (Gahan) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) (Criddle 1923; Ainslie 1929). A similar species, Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck, was later reported to also attack C. cinctus larvae (Muesebeck 1953; Somsen and Luginbill 1956). These parasitoids are now prevalent in wheat in some regions of Montana (Morrill et al. 1994, 1998; Morrill 1997). The life histories and phenologies of these sympatric idiobiont ectoparasitoids are similar. The ability to distinguish B. cephi from B. lissogaster is essential in elucidating their effects on populations of C. cinctus. We examined 159 females and 123 males of B. cephi from Chouteau, Hill, Stillwater, Teton, and Toole counties in Montana; Burke, Burleigh, Rolette, and Williams counties in North Dakota; Rock County in Minnesota; and southem Alberta (Rockyford and Consort). The 254 females and 215 males of B. lissogaster examined were from Chouteau, Hill, Teton, and Toole counties in Montana. Holotypes were compared to verify identifications.},

   abstract = {Smooth brome (Bromus inermis) is a cool-season rhizomatous grass of Eurasian origin that has escaped intentional plantings and spread widely in natural areas. A large body of work exists regarding smooth brome's biology and response to conservation management strategies designed to reduce its competitive effects on native prairie species, particularly for the tallgrass prairies of North America. Here we summarize that literature to improve restoration practice. In tallgrass prairie, smooth brome benefits from the early start of its growing season and its rhizomatous growth form, making it a strong competitor against native warm-season grasses. Late-spring burns timed to target smooth brome when root reserves are at their lowest have shown promise as a control strategy. Uncertainty remains, however, about the relative efficacy of fire, herbicide, mowing, or grazing to accomplish late-spring defoliation, the effect of repeated treatments, and the potential benefits of treatment combinations. The responses of resident or seeded natives to brome control treatments and/or the resulting decreases in brome cover also remain largely unexamined. Research focused on the questions we highlight would reduce costs associated with the control of smooth brome and increase confidence in the outcomes of restoration efforts. ©2011 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.},

   abstract = {Ecologists and farmers often have contrasting perceptions about the value of natural habitat in agricultural production landscapes, which so far has been little acknowledged in ecology and conservation. Ecologists and conservationists often appreciate the contribution of natural habitat to biodiversity and potential ecosystem services such as biological pest control, whereas many farmers see habitat remnants as a waste of cropland or source of pests. While natural habitat has been shown to increase pest control in many systems, we here identify five hypotheses for when and why natural habitat can fail to support biological pest control, and illustrate each with case studies from the literature: (1) pest populations have no effective natural enemies in the region, (2) natural habitat is a greater source of pests than natural enemies, (3) crops provide more resources for natural enemies than does natural habitat, (4) natural habitat is insufficient in amount, proximity, composition, or configuration to provide large enough enemy populations needed for pest control, and (5) agricultural practices counteract enemy establishment and biocontrol provided by natural habitat. In conclusion, we show that the relative importance of natural habitat for biocontrol can vary dramatically depending on type of crop, pest, predator, land management, and landscape structure. This variation needs to be considered when designing measures aimed at enhancing biocontrol services through restoring or maintaining natural habitat.},

   abstract = {Bracon cephi and Bracon lissogaster are native parasitoids of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus, an important pest of dryland wheat production. This spatial distribution study, using survey data from seven dryland wheat fields at four locations in north-central Montana over two years, examined: (1) the spatial distribution and spatial association of C. cinctus infestation and parasitism, and (2) parasitism in response to the level of C. cinctus infestation. Spatial distribution analyses revealed that C. cinctus infestations were significantly aggregated along field edges in three of five fields, while parasitism followed a random spatial distribution in all five fields. We demonstrate that the level of parasitism is highest for lower levels of C. cinctus infestation, in fields where parasitoids are either scarce or abundant. The combination of (1) a spatial aggregation of C. cinctus infestations along field edges, and (2) a potential negative interaction between parasitism and C. cinctus infestation may lower the level of parasitism at high host densities. This outcome can be viewed as beneficial to the insect pest, because parasitized C. cinctus larvae are at a greater risk of being cannibalized by conspecifics. An equally plausible hypothesis for this negative interaction is a limitation on the successful location of unparasitized hosts at higher host densities, which is also compelling because of the cryptic location of hosts within wheat stems that belie little visible evidence of infestation. Supporting data from other heavily infested fields that were sampled in 1999-2000 are used to illustrate the recurrence of this pattern. These findings are discussed in the context of developing redistribution strategies for introducing these parasitoids at sawfly infested locations where they are currently present at negligible levels. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Most studies quantifying the impacts of climatic variability and warming on crop production have focused on yields and have overlooked potential areal and frequency responses, potentially biasing future projections of food security in a warming world. Here we analyze US winter wheat production from 1970 to 2017 and find that harvest area ratio (harvested area/planted area, HAR) has declined while yields have risen, standing in stark contrast to other US staple crops. Although lower profitability due to declining wheat prices appears to explain the HAR trend, fluctuating wheat yields—largely explained by temperature exposure—drive the interannual variation of HAR. Our analysis suggests that warming-induced declines in HAR are comparable in magnitude to heat-related yield losses, and lower wheat prices amplify the sensitivity of HAR to warming and yield variation. Although irrigation mitigates some temperature-driven yield effects, it does little to change HAR, likely due to infrastructure cost and limited influence on relative profitability. Our results suggest that an accurate quantification of climate impacts on crop production must account for harvested area response, and that future adaptation strategies should not only target crop choice and management but also harvest incentives.},
